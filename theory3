JMS
    Use PTP messaging when every message you send must be processed successfully by one consumer.
    A JMS client that sends (or publishes) a message is called a producer, whereas a JMS client that receives (or subscribes) to a message is called a consumer.

Message driven bean
    A message driven bean is like stateless session bean that encapsulates the business logic and doesn't maintain state.
    To create the message driven bean, you need to declare @MessageDriven annotation and implement MessageListener interface.
