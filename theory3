JMS
    Use PTP messaging when every message you send must be processed successfully by one consumer.
    A JMS client that sends (or publishes) a message is called a producer, whereas a JMS client that receives (or subscribes) to a message is called a consumer.

Message driven bean
    A message driven bean is like stateless session bean that encapsulates the business logic and doesn't maintain state.
    To create the message driven bean, you need to declare @MessageDriven annotation and implement MessageListener interface.
    

Class loading
    Classes are introduced into the Java environment when they are referenced by name -> new or static method
    All Java virtual machines include one class loader that is embedded in the virtual machine. This embedded loader is called the primordial class loade
    
    ClassLoader in Java works on three principle: delegation, visibility and uniqueness.
     Delegation principle forward request of class loading to parent class loader and only
     loads the class, if parent is not able to find or load class. Visibility principle 
     allows child class loader to see all the classes loaded by parent ClassLoader, but
     parent class loader can not see classes loaded by child. Uniqueness principle 
     allows to load a class exactly once, which is basically achieved by delegation
     and ensures that child ClassLoader doesn't reload the class already loaded by parent.
      
     There are three default class loader used in Java, Bootstrap , Extension and System or Application class loader.
